GROWING TOMATOES FROM SEED:
Growing tomatoes from seed is the most cost-effective method of growing your own crop. You will need small pots or clean seed trays at least 1in (3cm) deep.

Step 1 :
Fill the pots/trays with good quality seed compost and make sure the surface is level and firm. 'Plants in the Nightshade family - which includes tomatoes - prefer growing in soil that is more acidic,' advises Mark Macdonald of West Coast Seeds.

Step 2 :
Sow the seeds about 1in (3cm) apart and cover with a light sprinkling of compost 

Step 3 :
Water using a watering can with a fine rose.

Step 4 :
Place in a propagator or cover with clear plastic or a sheet of glass and put them somewhere warm to germinate such as a warm windowsill - keeping them at around 64°F (18°C) to 77°F (25°C) is ideal.

Step 5 :
Remove the lid once the plants have germinated to help prevent the plants ‘damping off’, advises a horti expert at seed suppliers Dobies.

Step 6 :
Transplant into 3½in (9cm) pots when two 'true' leaves have formed - leaves formed after the first pair, which will be after approximately 14 days.

***TOP TIP: 'Watering the seedlings first will make it easier to pry them apart. Holding plants by a leaf will prevent your fingers damaging the stems,' says the Dobies' horti expert.
