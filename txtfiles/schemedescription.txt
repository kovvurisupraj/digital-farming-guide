Government of India introduced Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana in the Year 2015. PMKSY was formulated to expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, to reduce water wastage and to improve water use efficiency in agriculture. PMKSY is creating protective irrigation by harnessing rain water at micro level through Jal Sanchay and Jal Sinchan. PMKSY has been implemented with an outlay of Rs. 50,000 crore in five years (2015 to 2020). The net agricultural area of India is 200.8 million hectare, out of which only 95.8 million hectare i.e. 48% of area is covered under irrigation and 52% area is not covered under irrigation i.e. unirrigated area. Farmers in India majorly depending on rainfall for irrigation and it leads to less production output from farms. Components of PMKSY : Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme(AIBP). PMKSY – Har Khet Ko Pani. PMKSY – Per Drop More Crop. PMKSY –Watershed Development. Out of about 141 m.Ha of net area sown in the country,about 65 million hectare (or 45%) is presently covered under irrigation. Substantial dependency on rainfall makes cultivation in unirrigated areas a high risk, less productive profession. Empirical evidences suggest that assured or protective irrigation encourages farmers to invest more in farming technology and inputs leading to productivity enhancement and increased farm income.

The Standing Committee on Agriculture (Chair: Mr. Hukmdev Narayan Yadav) submitted its report on ‘Agriculture Marketing and Role of Weekly Gramin Haats’ on January 3, 2019. Agriculture marketing in most states is regulated by the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) established by state governments. Small and marginal farmers face various issues, such as inadequate marketable surplus, long distance to nearest APMC markets, and lack of transportation facilities, in selling their produce in APMC markets. Gramin Haats are markets in rural areas where such farmers can sell their produce without going to APMC markets. The Committee noted that since the GrAM scheme requires funds available under various government schemes, inter-ministerial coordination is required at the central and state levels. It recommended that a monitoring committee should be formed for planning and time bound implementation of the scheme. In total, infrastruture in around 22,000 rural haats is to be upgraded and modernised with the corpus of almost Rs. 20 billion spread over 2-3 years. Of this in the first phase the centre has idetified around 1,878 rural haats, which includes the maximum around 564 haats in Andhra Pradesh, followed by 188 in Gujarat, 186 in Rajasthan, 182 in Tamilnadu and 176 in Telangana.
