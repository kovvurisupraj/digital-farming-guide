-ORGANIC FERTILIZERS:

a desirable level of organic carbon in the soil (0.3 -0.7%) must be maintained.
Application of organic matter to the soil is a must for supplying organic carbon.

Well decomposed farm yard manure or compost @8-10 tonnes/ha


-INORGANIC FERTILIZERS:

Phosphorus

Deficiency symptoms:
K Deficiency symptoms more pronounced on younger leaves.
Leathery texture of leaves.
Red purple coloured leaf tips and margins.

Management:
Apply 50 kg P2O5 as basal dose.
For immediate management of P deficiency water soluble fertilizers like single superphosphate should be applied based on severity of deficiency.
Application of Rock Phosphate on acidic soils is helpful.
2% DAP foliar spray for immediate effects.


Sulphur

Deficiency symptoms:
Younger and middle leaves turn pale and yellow.
Papery leaves under severe deficiency.

Management:
Application of S containing fertilizers at like ammonium sulphate and single super phosphate at the time of sowing.
2.5 q/ha gypsum where P is not deficient.
Foliar spray of 0.5% S solution

Iron

Deficiency symptoms:                    	

Interveinal yellowing and chlorosis is observed on young and emerging leaves.


Management:
Soil application of FeSO4 (about 30 kg Fe ha-1) is benificial
Foliar applications of 2-3% solution of FeSO4 or Fe chelates.


Boron


Deficiency symptoms                    	

Necrotic areas are localized near the leaf margin.
Deficiency occurs in highly weathered acidic soils.

Management:
Soil applications of Borax @ 10 Kg/ha.
Foliar spray of 0.1 ppm boron solution.
